// Bug #139: Type checker allows assigning I64 to Ptr field
// This should be caught by typer as a type mismatch error

TestStruct := struct {
    mut ptr_field: Ptr = Ptr()
}

// This should be a type error: I64 (0) assigned to Ptr field
// NULL := 0 is I64, but ptr_field is Ptr
_s := TestStruct(ptr_field=0)
