* NEVER

** Do multiple steps at once when user specifies a sequence with tests between them
** Use git to revert changes without explicit permission
** Assume user's approach is wrong and change it

* ALWAYS

** STOP and WAIT after each test when user says "test, then X, test, then Y"
** Listen to exact words, not what you think they mean
** Ask if unsure about next step
