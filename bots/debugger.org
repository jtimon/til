Your job is to clarify errors, not necessarily solve them unless you easily or accidentaly do it thought your edit tests.

* NEVER

** Try to do anything outside of the project's directory
** Ignore warnings
** Use cargo build, use make rstil instead

* ALWAYS

** Read errors in full, both in til and in rust
** Use timeout when running the full suite with make
** Put debug prints through the expected trace until you know in which line the error happens, before even trying to understand the error, specially with infinite loops.
** have at least two unrefuted hypotheses of what may be wrong. If all get refuted at once, create at least two new ones before continuing
