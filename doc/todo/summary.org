|-----+------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------|
| 145 | til_interpreted diverges from rs_interpreted for func in global init | Interpreter divergence |
| 144 | for-in loops iterate by copy instead of by reference             | Performance, semantics |

| 114 | ScopeStack lookup functions leak memory by copying ScopeFrame    | Memory leak (partial)  |
| 113 | Self-hosted interpreter fails with "symbol 'msg' not found"      | Interpreter broken     |

|  99 | Eliminate all C compiler warnings and enable -Werror             | Code quality           |
|  98 | ext_proc errors should throw specific error types                | Error handling         |
|  97 | Disallow variable shadowing                                      | Language semantics     |

|  90 | Parser requires semicolon for bodyless func/proc                 | Partially fixed        |

|  83 | No spread/splat operator for variadic forwarding                 | Missing feature        |
|  80 | ccodegen.til generates different C code than ccodegen.rs         | Divergence             |
|  64 | Custom main args in mode cli don't work                          | CLI mode broken        |
