* TODO Forbid additional keywords

Additional keywords from other languages that could be forbidden with helpful error messages.

Currently implemented (4):
- const -> "Variables are immutable by default"
- var -> "Use 'mut' instead"
- fn -> "Use 'func' instead"
- try -> (error message exists)

Proposed additions:
- let -> "Use ':=' for declaration"
- class -> "Use 'struct' instead"
- interface -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- implements -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- extends -> "TIL doesn't have inheritance"
- public -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- private -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- protected -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- function -> (already returns Invalid token)
- global -> (already returns Invalid token)
- static -> (already returns Invalid token)

Note: function, global, static already return TokenType.Invalid but could have better error messages.
