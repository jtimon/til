* TODO Forbid additional keywords

Additional keywords from other languages that could be forbidden with helpful error messages.

Currently implemented (4):
- [X] const -> "Variables are immutable by default"
- [X] var -> "Use 'mut' instead"
- [X] fn -> "Use 'func' instead"
- [X] try -> (error message exists)

Proposed additions:
- [ ] let -> "Use ':=' for declaration"
- [ ] class -> "Use 'struct' instead"
- [ ] interface -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- [ ] implements -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- [ ] extends -> "TIL doesn't have inheritance"
- [ ] public -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] private -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] protected -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] function -> (already returns Invalid token)
- [ ] global -> (already returns Invalid token)
- [ ] static -> (already returns Invalid token)

Note: function, global, static already return TokenType.Invalid but could have better error messages.
