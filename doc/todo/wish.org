- [X] var -> "Use 'mut' instead"
- [X] fn -> "Use 'func' instead"
- [X] function -> "Use 'func' or 'proc' instead"
- [X] try -> "TIL uses 'catch' blocks without 'try'"
- [X] let -> "Use ':=' for declaration"
- [X] class -> "Use 'struct' instead"
- [ ] interface -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- [ ] implements -> "TIL doesn't have interfaces"
- [ ] extends -> "TIL doesn't have inheritance"
- [ ] public -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] private -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] protected -> "TIL doesn't have visibility modifiers"
- [ ] global -> "Use mut declaration at file root"
- [ ] static -> "Use struct/impl organization"

* TODO More dynamic error messages

Error messages that could include the user's identifier and value for easier copy-paste:

- [X] "'foo' already declared" (includes the actual identifier)
- [X] "func 'bar' does not return anything" (includes the function name)
- [X] "struct 'MyStruct' has no member 'baz'" (includes struct and member names)
- [X] "enum 'Status' has no variant 'Done'" (includes enum and variant names)
- [X] var aaa = 5 -> "mut aaa := 5"
- [ ] let my_global = 42 -> "my_global := 42"
- [ ] global my_counter = 0 -> "mut my_counter := 0" (+ note about root-level declarations being globals in certain modes)
