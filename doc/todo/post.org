* Overview

This document tracks features, improvements, and optimizations that can be
deferred until after self-hosting is achieved. These are not blocking the
self-hosted TIL interpreter but are planned for future development.

For bugs, see bugs.org. For language design decisions, see future.org.

* Open Issues

** Issue #152: Extract information from post_old.org
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2026-01-29
:IMPACT: Documentation cleanup
:STATUS: Open
:END:

*** Description
The old post.org (now post_old.org) contains valuable TODOs and design notes
that need to be reviewed and migrated:

1. Items that are now DONE should be documented or removed
2. Items that duplicate future.org issues should be consolidated
3. Unique items should get proper issue numbers here or in future.org
4. Outdated information should be corrected or removed

*** Items to Review
- own keyword (DONE - see ownership.org)
- ? operator (designed - see errors.org)
- Closures/nested functions
- Namespace imports (may duplicate Issue #109)
- Macros (may duplicate Issue #88)
- Unicode support
- Operator overloading
- Various type system enhancements
- Mode system enhancements (safe_script, pure)
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling enhancements

*** After Extraction
Once all information is extracted and properly tracked, post_old.org can be
deleted.
