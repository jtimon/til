* Overview

This document tracks long-term language design decisions that are not bugs
but need consideration. Unlike bugs.org (specific problems to fix), these
are open questions about language direction.

* Open Issues

** Issue #66: Variable Shadowing Policy
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-12-31
:IMPACT: Language design, Rust/TIL parity, developer experience
:STATUS: Open
:RELATED: Bug #65 (specific shadowing divergence)
:END:

*** Background
Bug #65 was caused by Rust code using variable shadowing (~let custom_type_name = ...~
to shadow an existing variable), but TIL doesn't support shadowing, so the TIL
translation used a different variable name (~resolved_type_name~) and then
inconsistently used the old name later.

*** Current Behavior (Tested 2025-11-10)

1. *~_~ reuse in same scope*: ALLOWED
   - ~_ := 5~ followed by ~_ := 10~ works
   - Universal in all languages - ~_~ is special

2. *Regular variable same-scope shadowing*: ALLOWED
   - ~x := 5~ followed by ~x := 10~ works
   - Creates new binding, not reassignment

3. *Type-change shadowing*: NOT ALLOWED
   - ~y := 5~ followed by ~y := "hello"~ fails type checking
   - Treated as reassignment to existing variable

4. *Nested-scope shadowing*: PARTIALLY WORKS (buggy)
   - Inner ~z := 10~ is allowed after outer ~z := 5~
   - BUT: Inner declaration MUTATES outer variable
   - This is likely a bug - should create new binding

*** Decision Needed

Options:
1. *Allow full shadowing like Rust* (including type changes)
   - Pro: 1:1 translation from Rust to TIL
   - Pro: Familiar to Rust developers
   - Con: Can hide bugs (accidentally reusing variable name)

2. *Prohibit same-scope shadowing like Go/Haskell* (except for ~_~)
   - Pro: Clearer code, no hidden rebinding
   - Con: Rust code needs different variable names when porting

3. *Current inconsistent behavior* (not recommended)
   - Pro: None
   - Con: Confusing, leads to bugs like Bug #65

*** Interim Rule (Until Decided)

To avoid Rust/TIL divergence like Bug #65:
- *Avoid shadowing in Rust code* - use different variable names
- *Use ~resolved_X~ pattern* - when transforming a variable, use a new name
- *-Wshadow enabled* - gcc warns about shadowing in generated C code

This rule is documented in CLAUDE.md.

*** Action Items
- [ ] Fix nested-scope shadowing bug (high priority)
- [ ] Evaluate shadowing usage in self-hosted codebase
- [ ] Choose consistent shadowing policy
- [ ] Implement in type checker
- [ ] Document decision
