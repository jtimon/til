* Pass-by-reference for non-copy params in ccodegen

** Goal
Simplify ccodegen by making all non-copy parameters pass by reference in C,
matching TIL's actual semantics where only "copy" is truly by-value.

** TIL Parameter Semantics
- const (default): by reference in TIL, should be "const Type*" in C
- mut: by reference, should be "Type*" in C
- copy: by value (the ONLY truly by-value case)
- own: by reference, like mut

** Changes Needed
1. emit_func_signature: use "const Type*" for const params, "Type*" for own/mut
2. param tracking: change from "is_mut" to "!is_copy"
3. hoisting: simplify - only copy args don't need address-taking
4. Port to ccodegen.til

** Expected Outcome
- Simpler hoisting detection (copy is the only special case)
- May fix hidden bugs including Bug #47
- Report line count reduction

** Status
Partial changes made to ccodegen.rs but broken - literals need hoisting.
User insight: hoisting should be SIMPLER with this change, not more complex.
