#+TITLE: Pre-Self-Hosting TODO List
#+AUTHOR: rstil Development
#+DATE: 2025-11-12

* Overview

This document tracks TODOs in the Rust implementation (rstil) that must be completed before the self-hosted til interpreter can run successfully.

Current Status: Core language features complete. Error handling standardized. One remaining API cleanup task.

Scope: This focuses on rstil (Rust) implementation issues, NOT on completing the til-based interpreter/typer/etc.

* TODO Active Items

- [ ] Standardize len/cap API across collections
  - Current inconsistency: Array has len field, Vec has len+cap fields, Map has size field, Str has len() method
  - Goal: Consistent naming and access patterns across all collections

* Notes

Focus on rstil, Not til Implementation:
This tracks what the Rust interpreter (rstil) needs to support self-hosting.
Completing interpreter.til, typer.til, etc. is the GOAL of self-hosting, not prerequisites.

Workarounds Are Okay Temporarily:
Some workarounds are acceptable short-term. Priority is getting rstil stable enough to run the self-hosted code.
