* TIL Language Design Notes

** Mutability Rules
- All variables and function arguments are immutable (const) by default.
- To make a variable or argument mutable, declare it with the 'mut' keyword.

** Argument Passing
- All function arguments are passed by reference by default.
- There is no syntax noise like '&' or '*' in function calls or definitions.
- Mutability is controlled explicitly with 'mut'.

** Ownership and Parameter Passing Semantics

*** Const Parameters (Immutable Borrow)
- Function arguments are const (immutable) and passed by reference by default.
- No keyword needed - const is the implicit default behavior.
- When we say "const parameters" or "const arguments", we mean parameters without 'mut'.
- Safe to pass by reference because:
  - Arguments are const (cannot be modified)
  - Arena allocation model never deletes memory
  - No dangling reference risk
- Zero copy overhead for const parameters.

*** Mut Parameters (Mutable Borrow)
- Declared with 'mut' keyword: ~func(mut x: I64)~
- MUST be passed by reference so modifications affect the caller's value.
- Copy-modify-copyback semantics would be:
  - Wasteful (unnecessary copy overhead)
  - Semantically incorrect (caller expects modifications to original)
- Currently has limitations with struct field modifications (see Bug #10).

*** Own Keyword (Future - Ownership Transfer)
- Syntax: ~func(own x: MyStruct)~
- Transfers ownership from caller to callee (move semantics).
- Caller loses access to the value after the call.
- Callee takes full ownership and can consume/modify/return it.
- Solves struct field modification issues by avoiding borrow semantics.
- Similar to Rust's move semantics.

*** Copy Keyword (Future - Explicit Copy)
- Syntax: ~func(copy x: MyStruct)~
- Creates an independent copy of the argument.
- Rarely needed - use cases unclear.
- Caller retains original, callee gets independent copy.
- Both can modify their own version without affecting the other.

*** Implementation Status
- Current: Internally doing copies for all arguments (temporary implementation).
- Target: Reference-transparent by default (pass everything by reference unless 'copy').
- Arena model: All allocations in arena, deletion is placeholder functionality (never tested).
- Migration path: Moving towards zero-copy reference semantics for performance.

** Structs and Pointers
- Structs are value types, but passed by reference by default.
- Field access always uses the dot '.' operator, regardless of whether the struct is a reference or a pointer (like in Odin or Zig).
- Enums are the other data type, like rust enums (aka algebraic datatypes, aka tagged unions)
- Actually, there are also definitions of functions, structs and enums, but definitions cannot be reasigned (aliases) or passed as arguments yet.

** Allocation Model
- Structs and arrays are stack-allocated by default when possible.
- Heap allocation happens only when necessary (e.g., dynamic storage, escapes).
- There is no language-level 'const' keyword for optimization hints — the compiler is expected to handle this automatically.

** No & or * noise
- Unlike Rust or C++, there is no explicit reference '&' or dereference '*' syntax in regular code.
- Users think in terms of values and mutability, not pointers/references/by_values.

** Functions: 'func' vs 'proc'
- 'func' defines a pure function with no side effects. It must always return a value or throw an error.
  - Similar to D's 'pure', but integrated at the language level.
  - If it doesn’t return, it must 'throw' (future feature).
- 'proc' defines a procedure that can perform side effects and may return nothing (void).
  - Procs are allowed to return values too, but they are not pure.

** Type System
- Statically typed language: all types are known at compile time.
- Type inference is supported in declarations, but never for function definition returns or throws.
- Types must be explicitly declared in struct definitions and function definition arguments? // TODO decide, this is important

** Error Handling Model (Planned)
- 'throws' declares the possible thrown types explicitly (like Java but works like Rust/Roc).
- 'throw' works like a return, but for the error path.
- 'catch' blocks handle thrown values without requiring 'try'. 'catch' blocks are placed freely but only catch earlier throws.
- All function calls that can throw must be marked visually with '?'.
- Both 'func' and 'proc' can throw errors.

Remember that even C can do quite well because it has mutable arguments (aka pointer arguments) and thus you can always return your
 real return like that and reserve the return value for errors.
By convention, the errors of each function are enumerated and documented as negative values to be returned.
But most "pure functional" languages can't have mutable argumments.
C is not included in the table though, perhaps it should.

Likewise, TIL has "mmultiple return values" planned too, so eventually users can use the Go/Odin syntax if they preffer it.
Same for rust style once TIL has templates.

The "extra" column is about readability, pure syntax bikesheeding, no
functionality at all, besides the type checking for the syntax
bikeshed itself.

As far as I understand, instead of using try blocks, zig mandates to preclude with "try" any statement that may throw something.
This is not necessary, but it is good for readability, for identifying faster where the errors may be thrown from.

But that's limited to "per-line" (per-statemment).
But serveral calls may throw within the same statemnt (for example, the arguments of a function call may be other function calls)
Similarly, rust uses the '!' convention for macros and roc uses it for procs (aka almost pure functions with managed effects in their fff language).
Similarly, TIL could adopt a convention for ending proc names with !, why not, we can even check that depending on the mode.

I personally preffer the rust syntax for the zig intent, if I understood it correctly, which is a "?" right after the call.
In rust, you only use that to rethrow automatically. In til it will be always, even if you catch right after the call.

NOTE: My understanding of other languages is not complete. Not even of my own since it is a work in progress (WIP).

** Design Inspiration
- D's has 'pure' functions, I think the way I would like it, but I didn't know.
- Mode system: inspired by platform-target systems in build tools, but one mode per file rather than per-project.
- Error model draws inspiration from...see table
- Pass-by-reference simplicity from Java, Swift, Kotlin, Mojo
- Efficient like C++'s 'const AAA&', but ergonomic and safe* (memory safety is to be decided, probably user configurable by mode).
- mut syntax inspired in rust
- enums inspired in rust, roc, haskell...aka algebraic types, aka tagged unions
- Borrowing syntax simplicity from Pascal, Odin, Zig, and Jai, and more.
- And much more, just trying to give some credit, but being exhaistive on this is a task in itself.
