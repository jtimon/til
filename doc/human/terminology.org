#+TITLE: TIL Terminology Guide

* Overview

This document defines terminology used in TIL documentation and codebase to maintain consistency and clarity.

* Function vs Func/Proc/Macro

** "Functions" (general term)
When used generically, "functions" refers to ALL callable constructs in TIL, including:
- =func= (pure functions)
- =proc= (procedures with side effects)
- =macro= (future: compile-time code generation)

** "Func" and "Proc" (specific terms)
When being specific about which type of callable:
- Use =func= for pure functions (no side effects, must return a value)
- Use =proc= for procedures (may have side effects, may or may not return)
- Use =func/proc= when discussing both explicitly
- Future: =funcs/procs/macros= when all three are relevant

** Usage Examples

*Generic (includes all types):*
- "User-defined functions support variadic arguments"
- "This function takes two parameters"
- "Functions must explicitly declare what they can throw"

*Specific (distinguishes types):*
- "Core func 'malloc' takes exactly 1 argument"
- "Core proc 'single_print' takes exactly 1 argument"
- "The validate_arg_count helper is only for ext funcs/procs"
- "Future: funcs/procs/macros will have different call conventions"

** Rationale

Using "functions" as the generic term aligns with common programming terminology while maintaining precision when needed. The =func/proc= distinction is critical for:

1. **Type checking**: Funcs must return, procs may not
2. **Side effects**: Funcs are pure, procs may mutate state
3. **Error messages**: Users need to know which type they're calling
4. **Future extensibility**: Clear pattern for adding macros
