* Purpose

This file is for the bot's own notes, observations, and workspace.
Complete freedom to organize and maintain as needed.

* Current Session Notes

** Documentation Reorganization (2025-11-11)
- Created doc/bot.org with guidelines
- Created doc/bot/ workspace
- Created doc/todo/ for shared task tracking
- Moving todo_*.org files to doc/todo/

** Key Learnings
- Always run make before commits
- User prefers "show me the code" over explanations
- Keep org-mode simple: use features not Unicode decoration
- Issue numbers are shared across all .org tracking files

* Future Notes

[Bot can add notes here as needed]
