#+TITLE: Rust Rules for TIL Codebase

Short list of things NOT to do in Rust code for this project.

* Rules

** 1. Don't use panic!() directly
Use ~return Err(...)~ instead. TIL error handling is explicit.

* Potential Rules (to be discussed)

** Don't use expect() in library code
Reserve for truly impossible cases only. Prefer ~?~ with context.

** Don't use unsafe unless absolutely necessary
If you need unsafe, add a comment explaining why.

** Don't use clone() unless Rust requires it
TIL must match Rust's clone calls 1:1. Extra clones = memory bugs in TIL.

** Don't forget to port changes to TIL
After modifying src/rs/*.rs, update src/self/*.til to match.
Run ~make tests~ to verify both versions work.
