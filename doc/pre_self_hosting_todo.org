#+TITLE: Pre-Self-Hosting TODO List
#+AUTHOR: rstil Development
#+DATE: 2025-01-09

* Overview

This document tracks TODOs in the *Rust implementation (rstil)* that must be completed before the self-hosted til interpreter can run successfully.

*Current Status:* All documented bugs fixed (see [[file:rstil_bugs.md][rstil_bugs.md]]), but missing features and test gaps remain.

*Scope:* This focuses on rstil (Rust) implementation issues, NOT on completing the til-based interpreter/typer/etc.

* Progress Summary

| Component           | Status                          | Notes                                           |
|---------------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Known Bugs          | ✅ BUG #6 FIXED                 | Enum payloads now reserve max variant size      |
| Error Handling      | ✅ WORKING                      | throw/throws/catch fully functional             |
| Import System       | ✅ WORKING                      | Basic imports work in all modes                 |
| Test Suite          | ⚠️ PARTIALLY BLOCKED            | test_parser.til blocked by enum-as-payload      |
| Type System         | ⚠️ MISSING FEATURES             | Recursive enum payloads not supported           |
| Parser Homogenization | ⚠️ 85% COMPLETE                | Phases 0-3 done, need enum-as-payload support   |

* Critical: Missing rstil Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Missing Features

** TODO Support Recursive Enum Payloads (enums as payloads)              :HIGH:
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-01-09
:IMPACT: Blocks parser homogenization completion
:RELATED: Parser homogenization, Type system
:END:

*** Problem
TIL does not currently support using enum types as payloads for other enums.
This is required for proper parser data structures in parser.til.

Example that should work but doesn't:
#+BEGIN_SRC til
FunctionType := enum {
    FTFunc,
    FTProc,
}

ValueType := enum {
    TFunction: FunctionType,  // Enum as payload - NOT SUPPORTED
    TCustom: Str,             // Primitive as payload - WORKS
}

// This fails at runtime with:
// "get_enum: 'FunctionType' is not a custom enum type"
vt := ValueType.TFunction(FunctionType.FTFunc)
#+END_SRC

*** Current Workaround
Parser homogenization currently must use I64 to store enum variant indices instead
of the actual enum values, which loses type safety and clarity.

*** What's Needed
- [ ] Update init.rs to properly register and serialize enum definitions used as payloads
- [ ] Update interpreter.rs to handle enum-as-payload construction and access
- [ ] Add test cases for recursive enum payloads in src/test/enums.til
- [ ] Re-test parser.til import after fix

*** Impact
- Parser data structures cannot match Rust implementation exactly
- Type safety is compromised (using I64 instead of proper enum types)
- Harder to maintain parity between parser.til and parser.rs

** TODO Improve Forward Reference Error Messages                         :MEDIUM:
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-01-09
:IMPACT: Developer experience, debugging
:END:

*** Problem
When an enum references another enum that hasn't been defined yet (forward reference),
rstil gives an unclear error message at runtime instead of a clear parse-time error.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC til
ValueType := enum {
    TFunction: FunctionType,  // Forward reference - FunctionType not defined yet
}

FunctionType := enum {
    FTFunc,
    FTProc,
}
#+END_SRC

Current error (at runtime):
: get_enum: 'FunctionType' is not a custom enum type

Better error (at parse time):
: Forward reference: 'FunctionType' used in ValueType definition before being defined
: Hint: Move FunctionType definition before ValueType

*** What's Needed
- [ ] Add forward reference detection in parser.rs during enum definition parsing
- [ ] Provide clear error message with line numbers and helpful suggestion
- [ ] Document enum definition ordering requirements in language docs

*** Workaround
Manually ensure enum definitions are in dependency order (dependencies defined first).

* Critical: Missing rstil Features (Continued)

** TODO Fix Disabled Test Files                                      :HIGH:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILE: src/tests.til:44-46
:IMPACT: test_parser.til disabled due to Bug #6
:END:

*** Current State
- =src/test/test_lexer.til= - ✅ FIXED - Added catch blocks for I64_OverflowError and AllocError
- =src/test/test_parser.til= - ⚠️ BLOCKED by Bug #6 (enum payload corruption in struct field assignment)
- =src/tests.til:44-46= - test_lexer.til can be re-enabled, test_parser.til must stay disabled

*** Bug #6: Enum Payload Corruption
When assigning an enum to a struct field, the payload gets replaced with the struct type name:
- =NodeType.Identifier("foo")= becomes =NodeType.Identifier("Expr")= after assignment to =Expr.node_type=
- See [[file:rstil_bugs.md][rstil_bugs.md]] for full details
- Discovered 2025-01-09 during test_parser.til investigation

*** What's Needed
- [X] Fix test_lexer.til (DONE - added catch blocks)
- [ ] Re-enable test_lexer.til in src/tests.til
- [ ] Fix Bug #6 in rstil (interpreter.rs) before test_parser.til can work
- [ ] After Bug #6 fixed, re-enable test_parser.til

*** Why This Matters
These tests exercise critical lexer/parser functionality needed for self-hosting.

* High Priority: Known Bugs & Workarounds
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Bugs
:END:

** TODO Remove Workarounds for Fixed Enum Bugs                        :HIGH:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILE: src/core/parser.til:239, src/core/parser.til:320
:STATUS: Bugs fixed, workarounds still in code
:END:

*** Current State
All enum bugs are FIXED (see rstil_bugs.md), but workarounds remain:
- =src/core/parser.til:239= - "Workaround for rstil bug - enum payloads must be variables"
- =src/core/parser.til:320= - Same workaround repeated
- =src/core/lexer.til:586= - "Workaround for rstil bug - return in methods returns from caller"

*** Action Required
- [ ] Verify bugs are truly fixed by testing without workarounds
- [ ] Remove workaround code from parser.til (lines 239, 320)
- [ ] Test direct nested enum construction works
- [ ] Remove return workaround from lexer.til if bug #2 confirmed fixed
- [ ] Update comments to reference historical bug fixes

*** Why This Matters
Workarounds add complexity and may hide issues. Clean code is easier to maintain during self-hosting transition.

* Notes

** Focus on rstil, Not til Implementation
This document tracks what the *Rust interpreter (rstil)* needs to support self-hosting.

Completing interpreter.til, typer.til, etc. is a separate concern - those are the GOAL of self-hosting, not prerequisites.

** Workarounds Are Okay Temporarily
Some workarounds (like PatternInfo for tuples) are acceptable short-term. The priority is getting rstil stable enough to run the self-hosted code, even if that code has workarounds.
