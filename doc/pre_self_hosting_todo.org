#+TITLE: Pre-Self-Hosting TODO List
#+AUTHOR: rstil Development
#+DATE: 2025-01-09

* Overview

This document tracks TODOs in the *Rust implementation (rstil)* that must be completed before the self-hosted til interpreter can run successfully.

*Current Status:* All documented bugs fixed (see [[file:rstil_bugs.md][rstil_bugs.md]]), but missing features and test gaps remain.

*Scope:* This focuses on rstil (Rust) implementation issues, NOT on completing the til-based interpreter/typer/etc.

* Progress Summary

| Component           | Status                          | Notes                                  |
|---------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| Known Bugs          | ✅ ALL FIXED                    | See rstil_bugs.md                      |
| Error Handling      | ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED        | throw/throws/catch needs completion    |
| Import System       | ⚠️ MODE ISSUES                  | lib mode imports cause test failures   |
| Test Suite          | ⚠️ 4 TESTS DISABLED             | Mode inheritance, error handling       |
| Type System         | ⚠️ MINOR GAPS                   | Variadic args, some edge cases         |

* Critical: Missing rstil Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Missing Features
:END:

** TODO Complete Error Handling System (throw/throws/catch)        :BLOCKER:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILE: src/rs/interpreter.rs, src/rs/typer.rs
:STATUS: Partially implemented
:END:

*** Current State
- Basic throw/catch works in some contexts
- =src/tests.til:61= - errors.til test file commented out: "TODO implement, throw, throws and catch"
- =src/core/interpreter.til:571= - Throw/catch mechanism needs implementation
- =src/rs/typer.rs:1170= - "TODO: Implement special PanicError potentially thrown implicitly everywhere"

*** What Works
- Basic throw/catch syntax recognized
- Simple error struct throwing/catching
- Test cases in =src/test/errors.til= pass

*** What's Missing
- [ ] =throws= keyword fully implemented in lexer/parser
- [ ] Type checker validation for throws declarations
- [ ] PanicError implicit throwing mechanism
- [ ] Throws propagation checking (all throwable calls marked with ?)
- [ ] Better error messages with backtraces (src/rs/interpreter.rs:2545)

*** Blockers for Self-Hosting
The self-hosted code will need proper error handling for file I/O, parsing errors, type errors, etc.

** TODO Fix Import/Module System for lib Mode                       :BLOCKER:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILE: src/rs/init.rs, src/tests.til:44-46
:IMPACT: Blocks test_lexer.til and test_parser.til
:END:

*** Current State
- Basic imports work in most modes
- =src/tests.til:44-46= - test_lexer.til and test_parser.til disabled due to "mode inheritance issues with lib imports"
- =src/rs/init.rs:786= - "TODO: Cached type should support import returning struct_def"
- =README.org:208= - Import "useless" in lib mode (not fully implemented)

*** Issues
1. Mode inheritance not working correctly when importing lib files
2. Type caching doesn't support imports returning struct definitions
3. Circular dependency detection not robust

*** What's Needed
- [ ] Debug mode inheritance when importing from lib mode
- [ ] Fix struct_def caching in imports
- [ ] Test circular dependency detection (src/core/pure_std.til:3)
- [ ] Re-enable test_lexer.til and test_parser.til
- [ ] Document import behavior in different modes

*** Why This Blocks Self-Hosting
The self-hosted interpreter needs to import lexer.til, parser.til, etc. as libraries. If lib mode imports don't work, self-hosting can't work.

* High Priority: Known Bugs & Workarounds
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Bugs
:END:

** TODO Remove Workarounds for Fixed Enum Bugs                        :HIGH:
:PROPERTIES:
:FILE: src/core/parser.til:239, src/core/parser.til:320
:STATUS: Bugs fixed, workarounds still in code
:END:

*** Current State
All enum bugs are FIXED (see rstil_bugs.md), but workarounds remain:
- =src/core/parser.til:239= - "Workaround for rstil bug - enum payloads must be variables"
- =src/core/parser.til:320= - Same workaround repeated
- =src/core/lexer.til:586= - "Workaround for rstil bug - return in methods returns from caller"

*** Action Required
- [ ] Verify bugs are truly fixed by testing without workarounds
- [ ] Remove workaround code from parser.til (lines 239, 320)
- [ ] Test direct nested enum construction works
- [ ] Remove return workaround from lexer.til if bug #2 confirmed fixed
- [ ] Update comments to reference historical bug fixes

*** Why This Matters
Workarounds add complexity and may hide issues. Clean code is easier to maintain during self-hosting transition.

* Notes

** Focus on rstil, Not til Implementation
This document tracks what the *Rust interpreter (rstil)* needs to support self-hosting.

Completing interpreter.til, typer.til, etc. is a separate concern - those are the GOAL of self-hosting, not prerequisites.

** Workarounds Are Okay Temporarily
Some workarounds (like PatternInfo for tuples) are acceptable short-term. The priority is getting rstil stable enough to run the self-hosted code, even if that code has workarounds.
