#+TITLE: Pre-Self-Hosting TODO List
#+AUTHOR: rstil Development
#+DATE: 2025-11-10

* Overview

This document tracks TODOs in the *Rust implementation (rstil)* that must be completed before the self-hosted til interpreter can run successfully.

*Current Status:* All documented bugs fixed (see [[file:bugs.org][bugs.org]]). Parser homogenization complete. Ready for next phase.

*Scope:* This focuses on rstil (Rust) implementation issues, NOT on completing the til-based interpreter/typer/etc.

* Progress Summary

* Active TODOs

** TODO Improve Test Error Handling with ERROR: Prefix                  :LOW:
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-11-10
:IMPACT: Test suite quality, debugging
:PRIORITY: Low (doesn't block self-hosting)
:END:

*** Problem
Test catch blocks should print "ERROR: " prefix for unexpected errors to make test failures more visible.

*** Current Status
Partially implemented in dynamic_arrays.til. Currently using `exit(1)` to abort on unexpected errors, but may want to consider using `return` to allow remaining tests to continue running.

*** Current Pattern
#+BEGIN_SRC til
catch (err: AllocError) {
    println("ERROR:", loc(), "Unexpected AllocError during push")
    println(err.msg)
    exit(1)
}
#+END_SRC

*** Alternative Pattern to Consider
Using `return` instead of `exit(1)` to continue to next test:
#+BEGIN_SRC til
catch (err: AllocError) {
    println("ERROR:", loc(), "Unexpected AllocError thrown:")
    println(err.msg)
    return  // Skip this test but continue with remaining tests
}
#+END_SRC

*** Benefits
- "ERROR: " prefix makes failures immediately visible in test output
- `exit(1)`: Fails fast, prevents cascading failures
- `return`: Allows test suite to continue, shows all failures at once
- Helps distinguish expected errors from unexpected ones in test logs

*** Scope
Review and decide on approach, then update catch blocks throughout test files:
- src/test/arrays.til
- src/test/dynamic_arrays.til (partially done with exit(1))
- src/test/test_parser.til
- Other test files with similar patterns

** TODO Fix Error Line Numbers from Imported Files                      :LOW:
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-11-10
:IMPACT: Developer experience, debugging
:PRIORITY: Low (doesn't block self-hosting)
:END:

*** Problem
Error messages from imported files show incorrect/duplicated file paths and misleading line numbers.

See Bug #9 in [[file:bugs.org][bugs.org]] for details and examples.

*** Impact on Self-Hosting
Low - This is a quality-of-life issue that makes debugging harder but doesn't prevent the self-hosted interpreter from running.

* Recently Completed

** DONE Improve Forward Reference Error Messages                         :MEDIUM:
CLOSED: [2025-11-10]
:PROPERTIES:
:DISCOVERED: 2025-01-09
:FIXED: 2025-11-10
:IMPACT: Developer experience, debugging
:COMMIT: 7bfec12
:END:

*** Solution Implemented
Forward declarations already worked! The real issue was that completely undefined types were silently accepted.

Added compile-time validation in typer.rs:
- check_enum_def() now validates custom types exist in context
- check_struct_def() now validates member types exist in context
- Both check that types are actually enums/structs, not values

*** Key Discovery
The original example from the TODO already works:
#+BEGIN_SRC til
ValueType := enum {
    TFunction: FunctionType,  // Forward reference - works!
}

FunctionType := enum {
    FTFunc,
    FTProc,
}
#+END_SRC

Forward references work for:
- Enum payloads (enum -> enum, enum -> struct)
- Struct members (struct -> enum, struct -> struct)
- Function parameters and return types
- Struct method return types

*** Error Messages
Now gives clear compile-time errors for truly undefined types:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
src/test/test_undefined_type.til:4:12: type ERROR: Enum variant 'Variant' uses undefined type 'NonExistentType'.
Hint: Make sure 'NonExistentType' is defined before this enum.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests:
- forward_declarations.til: Tests all forward reference scenarios
- test_undefined_type.til: Verifies undefined enum types error properly
- test_undefined_struct_type.til: Verifies undefined struct member types error
- test_original_forward_ref.til: Original example works as expected

* Notes

** Focus on rstil, Not til Implementation
This document tracks what the *Rust interpreter (rstil)* needs to support self-hosting.

Completing interpreter.til, typer.til, etc. is a separate concern - those are the GOAL of self-hosting, not prerequisites.

** Workarounds Are Okay Temporarily
Some workarounds (like PatternInfo for tuples) are acceptable short-term. The priority is getting rstil stable enough to run the self-hosted code, even if that code has workarounds.
